# Space Battle
Click Based Browser Game using DOM manipulation and gifs for animation.

## Motivation
This project was one of the first DOM manipulation projects that I worked on. I wanted to make a game visually pleasing. Since I was new to javascript and DOM manipulation, all the animations were created in photoshop as Gifs. 

## Build Status
The game is fully functional in the Web Browser. Also, the game has been optimized for mobile as well. The game is able to randomize the health, hitpoints, and accuracy of each of the enemy alien ships.

## Tech/framework used
Javascript with DOM manipulation, html, and css. Photoshop was used to create the Gifs used for the main page and the laser animation.

## Features
The game features a hero ship, and 5 enemy alien ship. The player always gets to go first. The player has the option to attack or run away. If the player runs away, the game is over. After the player attacks, the enemy has a chance to attack if they are still alive. One the enemy runs out of health, the next enemy will move into its place. The game continues until either the player defeats all of the enemy ships, or the player is defeated by the aliens.

## Installation
There are no dependencies for this game. All of the assets including the ships, animations, and red X's are in the img folder.
